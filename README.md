Welcome!

This work was completed in pursuit of an MSc in Advanced Mechanical Engineering at Cardiff University during the 2024/25 academic year.

Some key things to note - my configuration was:

  IDE:         spyder 5.4.1
  
  numpy:       1.26.4
  
  scipy:       1.11.4
  
  matplotlib:  3.9.2

I used Anaconda Navigator - which was downloaded to my machine - to access spyder.

There are four .zip files in the main branch that will need to be downloaded;
all of the files will need to be placed into a single folder for the modularity
to function.

Please note I have also uploaded the 20 Credit Report that was researched
and written in preparation for this 60 Credit Dissertation; I had to upload
this in three parts due to its size.
